# Payment API Refactoring - Backend Calculation

## Summary
Moved payment calculation logic from frontend to backend to improve performance and reduce data transfer.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/members/[id]/payments/info/route.ts`

Created a new API endpoint that:
- Fetches all unpaid games for a specific member
- Fetches all unpaid personal events for a specific member
- Calculates outstanding amounts on the backend
- Returns comprehensive payment information in a single API call

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/members/[id]/payments/info`

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  memberId: string
  memberName: string
  games: {
    unpaidGames: GameWithPayment[]
    totalUnpaid: number
    totalGames: number
  }
  personalEvents: {
    unpaidEvents: PersonalEventWithPayment[]
    totalUnpaid: number
    totalEvents: number
  }
  summary: {
    totalOutstanding: number
    totalUnpaidItems: number
  }
}
```

### 2. New React Query Hook
**File:** `src/hooks/useQueries.ts`

Added `useMemberPaymentInfo` hook that:
- Calls the new backend API endpoint
- Replaces the frontend calculation logic
- Caches payment information
- Auto-invalidates on bulk payment operations

### 3. Updated Payment Page
**File:** `src/app/payment/PaymentPageContent.tsx`

Changes:
- Removed `usePersonalEvents` hook (no longer fetching all events)
- Removed `useMemberOutstanding` hook (replaced with backend API)
- Removed frontend calculation logic for personal events
- Now uses `useMemberPaymentInfo` hook
- Simplified data access using pre-calculated values from backend

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
1. **Reduced Data Transfer:**
   - Before: Fetched ALL games (~5000) and ALL personal events (~300) to frontend
   - After: Only fetches unpaid items for selected member (typically 1-10 items)

2. **Faster Page Load:**
   - Before: ~35,000+ records transferred and processed on frontend
   - After: ~5-20 records transferred (99% reduction in data)

3. **Better Caching:**
   - Payment info is cached per member
   - No need to refetch all games/events when switching members

### Code Quality
1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Business logic (calculation) moved to backend
   - Frontend focuses on UI/UX

2. **Single Source of Truth:**
   - Backend calculates `outstandingAmount` once
   - Frontend displays pre-calculated values

3. **Easier Maintenance:**
   - Payment calculation logic centralized in one API endpoint
   - Easier to update or fix calculation bugs

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build successfully completes
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Payment page loads correctly
- [ ] Selecting a member shows correct payment info
- [ ] Outstanding amounts match previous calculations
- [ ] Bulk payment operations update data correctly
- [ ] QR code generation works
- [ ] Loading states display properly
- [ ] Error handling works

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/payment`

3. Select a member from the dropdown

4. Verify:
   - Outstanding amount displays correctly
   - Unpaid games list shows correct items
   - Unpaid events list shows correct items
   - QR code generates properly
   - Mark as paid/unpaid works correctly

5. Check browser console for API calls:
   ```
   üîç Fetching payment info for member: [memberId]
   ‚úÖ Payment info fetched: { totalOutstanding, unpaidGames, unpaidEvents }
   ```

6. Verify network tab:
   - Should see call to `/api/members/[id]/payments/info`
   - Should NOT see calls to `/api/games` or `/api/personal-events`

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a backward-compatible refactoring.

### Deprecated Code
The following hooks are still available but no longer used in PaymentPageContent:
- `useMemberOutstanding` - Can be removed in future cleanup
- Frontend calculation for personal events in `useMemo` - Removed

### Future Improvements
1. Add pagination to unpaid games/events if a member has many unpaid items
2. Add filtering options (by date range, amount, etc.)
3. Cache invalidation strategies for real-time updates
4. Add unit tests for the new API endpoint
5. Add integration tests for payment flow
