# 🎉 Database Backup System Successfully Implemented!

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested  
**Purpose:** Protect your data before deployments

---

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Backup Script** (`scripts/backup-to-csv.ts`)
- ✅ Exports all database tables to CSV files
- ✅ Creates timestamped backup folders
- ✅ Generates backup summary with record counts
- ✅ Handles large datasets efficiently
- ✅ Properly escapes CSV values

**Tables Backed Up:**
- Members (with avatars and status)
- Games (with all cost calculations)
- Game Participants (with payment status)
- Personal Events (custom events)
- Personal Event Participants (with custom amounts)

### 2. **Restore Script** (`scripts/restore-from-csv.ts`)
- ✅ Restores data from CSV backup files
- ✅ Validates backup directory before restore
- ✅ Handles foreign key constraints automatically
- ✅ Preserves all IDs and relationships
- ✅ Shows progress during restore

### 3. **NPM Scripts** (package.json)
```json
{
  "db:backup": "Create a full database backup",
  "db:restore": "Restore from a backup",
  "db:list-backups": "List all available backups",
  "pre-deploy": "Run pre-deployment checks and backup"
}
```

### 4. **Backup Directory Structure**
```
backups/
├── .gitignore              # Prevents committing backups
├── README.md               # Information about backups
└── 2025-10-17_09-18-20-631Z/
    ├── backup_summary.json
    ├── members.csv
    ├── games.csv
    ├── game_participants.csv
    ├── personal_events.csv
    └── personal_event_participants.csv
```

### 5. **Documentation**
- ✅ `BACKUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide with examples
- ✅ `DATABASE_BACKUP.md` - Quick reference
- ✅ `backups/README.md` - Backup directory info
- ✅ `scripts/pre-deploy.sh` - Automated pre-deployment script

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When to Create Backups

1. **Before Every Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run db:backup
   git push
   vercel deploy
   ```

2. **Before Schema Changes**
   ```bash
   npm run db:backup
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

3. **Daily/Weekly Snapshots**
   - Set up a cron job or GitHub Action
   - Keep last 7-14 backups

### Where to Store Backups

**Local (Automatically):**
- `backups/` directory (gitignored)

**Cloud (Recommended):**
```bash
# Upload to Dropbox
cp -r backups/2025-10-17_09-18-20-631Z ~/Dropbox/goodminton-backups/

# Upload to AWS S3
aws s3 sync backups/ s3://my-bucket/goodminton-backups/

# Upload to Google Drive (using rclone)
rclone sync backups/ gdrive:goodminton-backups/
```

### Backup Rotation

Keep your backups directory clean:

```bash
# Keep only last 7 backups
cd backups
ls -t | tail -n +8 | xargs rm -rf
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ Backups are **gitignored** (won't be committed)
- ✅ CSV files are **human-readable** (easy to inspect)
- ✅ IDs are **preserved** (maintain relationships)
- ⚠️ **Store backups securely** (contain sensitive data)

   tar -czf backup-2025-10-17.tar.gz 2025-10-17_09-18-20-631Z/
   ```

4. **Backup Verification**
   - Automated restore tests
   - Data integrity checks

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "ts-node command not found"
**Solution:** The tsconfig is now configured. Try running the command again.

### Problem: "Cannot find backup directory"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the correct path:
```bash
npm run db:list-backups  # Find your backup
npm run db:restore -- ./backups/[YOUR_TIMESTAMP]
```

### Problem: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** Ensure `.env` has correct `DATABASE_URL`
