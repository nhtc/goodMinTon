## 📋 Export Examples

### Example 1: Game History with Filters

Currently exports ALL data regardless of filters. To export filtered data:

**Option 1:** Manual filtering in Excel

2. Use Excel's AutoFilter feature
3. Filter by "Trạng thái" column

**Option 2:** Future enhancement (filter before export)

### Example 2: Monthly Report

**Use Case:** Monthly financial report for accounting

1. Export all games
2. Open Excel file
3. Use "Thống kê" sheet for overview
4. Filter "Chi tiết" sheet by date range
5. Create pivot table for monthly totals

### Example 3: Member Payment Tracking

**Use Case:** Check who hasn't paid

1. Export games or events
2. Open "Chi tiết" sheet
3. Filter "Trạng thái" column by "❌ Chưa thanh toán"
4. Sort by "Người chơi" to see all unpaid per person

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Export Button Not Showing

**Cause:** No data to export  
**Solution:** Add some games or events first

### Download Doesn't Start

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Browser blocked popup** - Allow downloads from your site
2. **JavaScript disabled** - Enable JavaScript
3. **Network error** - Check console for errors

### Excel File Won't Open

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Excel not installed** - Try Google Sheets or LibreOffice
2. **Corrupted download** - Try exporting again
3. **Browser extension** - Disable ad blockers temporarily

### Vietnamese Characters Display Wrong

**Solution:** 
- Excel should handle UTF-8 automatically
- If not, open with Google Sheets first
- Or use LibreOffice Calc which has better UTF-8 support

### Export Takes Too Long

**If you have thousands of records:**
1. This is normal for large datasets
2. Wait for completion (don't close browser)
3. Consider exporting date ranges separately (future feature)
